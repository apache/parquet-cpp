# Bootstrapping the native toolchain with prebuilt binaries
#
# The purpose of this script is to download prebuilt artifacts of the native
# toolchain to satisfy the third-party dependencies. The script checks for the
# presence of NATIVE_TOOLCHAIN. NATIVE_TOOLCHAIN indicates the location where
# the prebuilt artifacts should be extracted to.
#
# The script is called as follows without any additional parameters:
#
#     python linux-toolchain.py
